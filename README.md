# php-rest-api-framework
This is a micro php rest api framework, to install your api on.
It implements the most basic specs for routing & middleware logic.
Also it has ready the most significant components of an API service, such as the Request, Response & Url objects and many more.

## What I wanted to do:
I wanted to study and dive into the very certain architecture technics that are used to build a rest api. Also I wanted to understand the very basic components that consist a rest api router. So I started learning and reading many interesting new things. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so I borrowed most of the practices from Skipperbent's Simple php router repository. The result after very hard work, is a minimal 2.5 lines of a fully functional version of a PHP REST Api Router.

## This I read:
- [What is REST](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [Best practices for REST API design](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/)
- [Representational State Transfer (REST) Architecture](https://www.service-architecture.com/articles/web-services/representational-state-transfer-rest.html)
- [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/)
- [Simple php router from scratch](https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router)
- [RESTful service resources](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/9.0.5?topic=applications-defining-resources-in-restful)
