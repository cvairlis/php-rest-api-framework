# php-rest-api-framework
This is a micro php rest api framework, to install your api on.
I implements the most basic specs for routing & middleware logic.
It also has ready the most significant components of an API service, such as the Request, Response & Url objects and many more.

Glory and honnor to **skipperbent simple-php-router**.

Navigate to [skipperbent's repository](https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router) to review the original implementation and take a more comprehensive picture of the full feature implementation.
